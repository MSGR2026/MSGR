# LightGCN Hyperparameters

# Model Architecture
# REUSE: Same embedding_size used in SGL
embedding_size: 64              # (int) The embedding size of users and items.
# REUSE: Same n_layers used in SGL
n_layers: 3                     # (int) The number of LightGCN layers for neighborhood aggregation.

# Regularization
# REUSE: Same reg_weight used in SGL
reg_weight: 0.0001              # (float) The L2 regularization weight for embeddings.
# REUSE: Same require_pow setting used in SGL
require_pow: False              # (bool) Whether to require pow when calculating regularization loss.

# DIFFERENT: SGL adds ssl_weight, ssl_temp, ssl_mode, ssl_ratio parameters for self-supervised learning

# Training
learning_rate: 0.001            # (float) Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
train_batch_size: 2048          # (int) Training batch size.

# Early Stopping
stopping_step: 10               # (int) Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.

# Evaluation
eval_batch_size: 4096           # (int) Evaluation batch size for full sort prediction.
