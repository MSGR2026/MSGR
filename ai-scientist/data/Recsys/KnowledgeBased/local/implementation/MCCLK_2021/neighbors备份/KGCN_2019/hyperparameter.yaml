# KGCN Hyperparameter Configuration
# Paper: Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommender Systems (WWW 2019)

# REUSE: Same embedding dimension as MCCLK
embedding_size: 64              # (int) Dimension of user, item and entity embeddings.

# SIMILAR: n_iter serves similar purpose to n_hops in MCCLK for multi-hop propagation
n_iter: 2                       # (int) Number of propagation iterations (H in paper).

# DIFFERENT: KGCN samples fixed neighbors; MCCLK uses full graph with dropout
neighbor_sample_size: 8         # (int) Number of neighbors to sample for each entity (K in paper).

# DIFFERENT: KGCN uses sum/concat/neighbor aggregators; MCCLK uses attention-based aggregation
aggregator: 'sum'               # (str) Type of aggregator function. Options: 'sum', 'concat', 'neighbor'.

# SIMILAR: Both use L2 regularization but MCCLK has additional contrastive loss weights
reg_weight: 1.0e-7              # (float) L2 regularization weight.

# Training parameters
learning_rate: 0.02             # (float) Learning rate for optimizer.
train_batch_size: 1024          # (int) Batch size for training.
