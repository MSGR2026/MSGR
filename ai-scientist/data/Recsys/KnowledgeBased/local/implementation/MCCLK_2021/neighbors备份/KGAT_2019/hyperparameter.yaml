# KGAT (Knowledge Graph Attention Network) Hyperparameters

# Embedding dimensions
# REUSE: Same embedding_size as MCCLK
embedding_size: 64              # (int) The embedding size of users, items and entities.
kg_embedding_size: 64           # (int) The embedding size of relations in knowledge graph (TransR relation dimension).

# Model architecture
# SIMILAR: n_layers serves similar purpose as n_hops in MCCLK
n_layers: 3                     # (int) The number of attentive embedding propagation layers.
# DIFFERENT: KGAT uses aggregator_type; MCCLK has fixed aggregation with attention option
aggregator_type: 'bi-interaction'  # (str) The type of aggregator: 'gcn', 'graphsage', or 'bi-interaction'.

# Regularization
# REUSE: Same reg_weight value as MCCLK
reg_weight: 1e-5                # (float) The L2 regularization weight for embeddings and parameters.

# Training settings
learning_rate: 0.001            # (float) Learning rate for Adam optimizer.

# Graph structure
# DIFFERENT: KGAT samples fixed neighbors; MCCLK uses full graph with dropout
neighbor_sample_size: 8         # (int) The number of neighbors to sample for each entity in CKG.
