# Embedding dimensions
embedding_size: 32  # (int) Embedding dimension for users, items, entities and relations. Paper suggests 8-64, with d=32 for most datasets

# GNN architecture
n_layers: 1  # (int) Number of GNN layers. Paper shows L=1-2 achieves best performance, L=4 causes over-smoothing

# Regularization weights
reg_weight: 1e-7  # (float) L2 regularization weight for embeddings. Following RippleNet's range (1e-7 to 1e-5)
ls_weight: 0.5  # (float) Label smoothness regularization weight λ. Paper suggests 0.1-1.0 as preferable range

# Training settings
learning_rate: 0.001  # (float) Learning rate. Paper uses 0.5 for some datasets but standard Adam rate works better with adaptive optimization
train_batch_size: 2048  # (int) Batch size for training
eval_batch_size: 4096  # (int) Batch size for evaluation
