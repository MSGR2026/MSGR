# DIFFERENT: SASRec uses Transformer layers/heads; SINE uses prototype_size and interest_size instead
n_layers: 2                     # (int) The number of transformer layers in transformer encoder.
n_heads: 2                      # (int) The number of attention heads for multi-head attention layer.
hidden_size: 64                 # (int) The number of features in the hidden state. # SIMILAR: corresponds to embedding_size in SINE
# DIFFERENT: SASRec has inner_size, dropout probs, hidden_act; SINE has tau_ratio, reg_loss_ratio instead
inner_size: 256                 # (int) The inner hidden size in feed-forward layer.
hidden_dropout_prob: 0.5        # (float) The probability of an element to be zeroed.
attn_dropout_prob: 0.5          # (float) The probability of an attention score to be zeroed.
hidden_act: 'gelu'              # (str) The activation function in feed-forward layer.
layer_norm_eps: 1e-12           # (float) A value added to the denominator for numerical stability. # REUSE: same as SINE
initializer_range: 0.02         # (float) The standard deviation for normal initialization.
loss_type: 'CE'                 # (str) The type of loss function. Range in ['BPR', 'CE']. # REUSE: same as SINE
train_neg_sample_args: ~        # CE loss must disable negative sampling or RecBole will error.
