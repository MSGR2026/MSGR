# REUSE: Same transformer architecture hyperparameters as FEARec
n_layers: 2                     # (int) The number of transformer layers in transformer encoder.
n_heads: 2                      # (int) The number of attention heads for multi-head attention layer.
hidden_size: 64                 # (int) The number of features in the hidden state.
inner_size: 256                 # (int) The inner hidden size in feed-forward layer.
# DIFFERENT: Lower dropout (0.2) compared to FEARec (0.5)
hidden_dropout_prob: 0.2        # (float) The probability of an element to be zeroed.
attn_dropout_prob: 0.2          # (float) The probability of an attention score to be zeroed.
hidden_act: 'gelu'              # (str) The activation function in feed-forward layer.
layer_norm_eps: 1e-12           # (float) A value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
initializer_range: 0.02         # (float) The standard deviation for normal initialization.
# DIFFERENT: mask_ratio is specific to BERT4Rec's masked language modeling objective, not used in FEARec
mask_ratio: 0.2                 # (float) The probability for a item replaced by MASK token.
loss_type: 'CE'                 # (str) The type of loss function.
train_neg_sample_args: ~        # CE loss must disable negative sampling or RecBole will error.
# DIFFERENT: transform and ft_ratio are BERT4Rec-specific for masked sequence generation
transform: mask_itemseq         # (str) The transform operation for batch data process.
ft_ratio: 0.5                   # (float) The probability of generating fine-tuning samples
