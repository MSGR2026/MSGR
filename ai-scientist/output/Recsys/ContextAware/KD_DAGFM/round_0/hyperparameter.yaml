# FFM (Field-aware Factorization Machines) Hyperparameter Configuration
# Reference: Yuchin Juan et al. "Field-aware Factorization Machines for CTR Prediction" in RecSys 2016

# Embedding size (number of latent factors k)
# Paper recommends k=4 for FFM on Criteo and Avazu datasets
# This is smaller than standard FM (40-100) due to field-aware design
