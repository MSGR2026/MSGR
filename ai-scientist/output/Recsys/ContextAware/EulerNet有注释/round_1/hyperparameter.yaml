# Embedding configuration
embedding_size: 10                # (int) The embedding size of features, aligned with baseline methods

# EulerNet specific parameters
order_list: [1, 2]                # (list of int) Interaction orders to model in complex space, reduced to avoid numerical instability
num_layers: 2                     # (int) Number of Euler interaction layers
drop_ex: 0.1                      # (float) Dropout rate for explicit (real) part, lowered for stability
drop_im: 0.1                      # (float) Dropout rate for implicit (imaginary) part, lowered for stability
reg_weight: 1e-4                  # (float) L2 regularization weight for model parameters, increased for stability
