# PGL_2025 hyper-parameters (MultiModal Recsys)

# --- model backbone ---
embedding_size: 64
feat_embed_dim: 64
n_ui_layers: 2
n_mm_layers: 1
knn_k: 10
mm_image_weight: 0.5

# --- principal subgraph learning ---
# default to local-aware (cheap & scalable); global-aware is only suitable for small graphs in this code
principal_type: "local"
local_p: [0.2, 0.3]          # p in paper, typical 0.3; add slightly smaller for robustness

# keep global-aware params for completeness (not searched unless principal_type switched manually)
global_gamma: 0.25           # gamma in paper, typical 0.25
global_eps: 0.001            # sparsification threshold for reconstructed adjacency

# --- SSL (feature masking InfoNCE) ---
ssl_weight: [0.05, 0.1, 0.5]         # lambda_SSL in paper search set
ssl_mask_ratio: [0.1, 0.2]           # rho in paper search set (keep small-mid to avoid over-noising)
ssl_tau: 0.2                         # tau typical 0.2

# --- regularization ---
reg_weight: [0.0, 1.0e-5]            # small L2 on sampled embeddings; consistent with LATTICE/FREEDOM practice
