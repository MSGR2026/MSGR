# Model architecture
n_layers: 2                     # (int) The number of propagation layers for both KG and collaborative views.
knn_k: 10                       # (int) The number of neighbors for semantic kNN item-item graph.

# Regularization
reg_weight: 1e-5                # (float) The L2 regularization weight for embeddings.

# Contrastive learning parameters
temperature: 0.2                # (float) The temperature parameter for InfoNCE contrastive loss.
alpha: 0.1                      # (float) Weight for local contrastive loss (cross-view item alignment).
beta: 0.1                       # (float) Weight for global contrastive loss (user-item alignment).

# Dropout rates
node_dropout_rate: 0.0          # (float) The node dropout rate (not actively used in current implementation).
mess_dropout_rate: 0.1          # (float) The message dropout rate during propagation.
