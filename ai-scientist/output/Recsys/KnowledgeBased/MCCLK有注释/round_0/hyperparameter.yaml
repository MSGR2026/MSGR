# MCCLK (Multi-level Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-aware Recommender System)
# Paper: SIGIR 2022

# Embedding dimensions
embedding_size: 64              # (int) The embedding size of users, items, and entities. Paper suggests 100-150, using 64 for efficiency.
kg_embedding_size: 64           # (int) The embedding size for TransR relation space.

# Model architecture
n_layers: 2                     # (int) Number of propagation layers for both KG and CF views.

# Regularization
reg_weight: 1e-5                # (float) L2 regularization weight. Paper suggests 0.001-0.1 for Bayesian priors.

# Knowledge graph loss weight
kg_weight: 1.0                  # (float) Weight for TransR knowledge graph embedding loss.

# Contrastive learning parameters
cl_weight: 0.1                  # (float) Weight for cross-view contrastive loss.
temperature: 0.2                # (float) Temperature parameter for InfoNCE contrastive loss.

# Dropout
mess_dropout: 0.1               # (float) Message dropout rate during propagation.
