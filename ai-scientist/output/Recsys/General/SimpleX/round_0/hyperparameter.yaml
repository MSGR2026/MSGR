# Embedding settings
embedding_size: 64              # (int) The embedding size of users and items. Paper uses 64 (matching LightGCN) or 128.

# Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) parameters
margin: 0.4                     # (float) Margin m in CCL loss. Paper tunes among 0~1 at interval of 0.1, 0.4 works for Amazon-Books.
negative_weight: 300            # (float) Weight w for negative loss in CCL. Paper searches among [1, 150, 300, 1000], 300 performs well.

# User representation fusion
gamma: 0.5                      # (float) Fusing weight g for combining user embedding and behavior aggregation. Paper reports 0.5 works best.

# Behavior aggregation
aggregator: mean                # (str) Aggregation strategy for behavior history. Options: 'mean', 'self_attention', 'user_attention'.
history_len: 50                 # (int) Maximum behavior sequence length K. Dataset-dependent with padding/truncation.

# Regularization
reg_weight: 1e-4                # (float) L2 regularization weight. Paper searches between 1e-9~1e-2.

# Training settings
train_neg_sample_args:
  distribution: uniform
  sample_num: 500               # (int) Number of negative samples. Paper searches from 1 to 2000, commonly 100, 500, or 1000.
