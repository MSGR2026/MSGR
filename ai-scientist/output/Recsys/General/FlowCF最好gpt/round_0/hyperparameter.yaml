# --- Discrete flow process ---
steps: 9                 # N, discretization steps (paper: 9 on ML-1M)
sampling_steps: 2        # inference Euler-like updates (paper: 2)
start_step: null         # start from second-to-last step by default (code derives s = N-1-K)

embedding_size: 10       # time embedding dim (paper: 10)
dims_dnn: [300, 300]     # MLP hidden dims (paper: [300, 300] for ML-1M)
mlp_act_func: tanh       # typical for DiffRec-style MLP; paper does not override activation
dropout: 0.1             # paper: fixed to 0.1
