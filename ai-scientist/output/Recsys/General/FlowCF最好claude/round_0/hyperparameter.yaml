# Flow Model Architecture
hidden_dims: [300, 300]          # (list of int) Hidden dimensions for MLP. Paper specifies [300, 300] for ML-1M.
embedding_size: 10               # (int) Timestep embedding dimension. Paper uses 10.
dropout: 0.1                     # (float) Dropout rate. Paper explicitly fixes at 0.1 for effective flow matching.
activation: 'tanh'               # (str) Activation function for MLP layers.
norm: False                      # (bool) Whether to normalize input with L2 normalization.

# Flow Discretization Parameters
steps: 9                         # (int) Number of discretization steps N. Paper uses 9 for ML-1M.
sampling_steps: 2                # (int) Number of inference steps. Paper achieves good performance with only 2 steps.
start_step: 7                    # (int) Starting step index for inference (second-to-last step = N-2 = 7 for N=9).
