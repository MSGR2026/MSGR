# Reference: Neighbor Layers Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (2025)

# Model Architecture
embedding_size: 64              # (int) The embedding size of users and items.
n_layers: 2                     # (int) The number of LightGCN layers (L). Paper uses 2 for Yelp/Alibaba, 3 for Pinterest/QB-Video.

# Regularization
reg_weight: 1e-4                # (float) λ₂: L2 regularization weight for embeddings.
require_pow: False              # (bool) Whether to require pow when calculating regularization loss.

# Contrastive Learning Settings
cl_weight: 1e-5                 # (float) λ₁: Contrastive learning loss weight.
temperature: 0.2                # (float) τ: Temperature parameter for InfoNCE loss.
n_groups: 2                     # (int) G: Number of contrastive view groups (neighbor layer pairs).
cl_scope: 'heterogeneous'       # (str) Contrastive scope: 'heterogeneous' (same type negatives) or 'entire' (all nodes as negatives).

# Training Settings
learning_rate: 0.001            # (float) Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
train_batch_size: 4096          # (int) Training batch size as specified in paper.

# Early Stopping
stopping_step: 20               # (int) Early-stop patience: number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.

# Evaluation
